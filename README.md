EarnGit is a token launchpad that ensures trading fees are claimed by the rightful GitHub repository owner.

Only authors can claim.
No impersonation.
No misattributed rewards.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past week, there has been a surge of GitHub repositories launching tokens on platforms like pump.fun and bags.fm.

This has created several recurring issues:

repositories with poor credibility launching tokens
low-quality or larp repositories farming attention
incorrect individuals receiving trading fees
X accounts linked that are not owned by the actual repository author
In many cases, the real developer receives nothing, while someone else captures the fees.

EarnGit exists to fix this.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What EarnGit Does
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EarnGit combines repository verification with token deployment and fee attribution.

It allows you to:

Scan and verify a GitHub repository
Evaluate repository quality and credibility
Deploy a token officially tied to the repository
Ensure only the rightful GitHub author can claim trading fees
Fees are not assigned to a wallet at deployment. They are claimed by the verified repository owner.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Claiming Works
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once a token is deployed for a repository:

A Rewards tab appears for that repo
The GitHub author links a wallet
The author presses Claim
Fees are released only if ownership is verified
No GitHub ownership → no claim.

This removes guesswork, trust assumptions, and impersonation.

Verification Model
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EarnGit verifies:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
repository ownership
author identity
repository metadata and signals
quality indicators (activity, structure, credibility)
Only repositories that pass verification are eligible for deployment.

Why This Matters
Developers build the code.
Developers should receive the rewards.

By assigning fees to the repository owner, EarnGit:

rewards real contributors
discourages larp and spam
increases credibility for repo-backed tokens
aligns incentives between builders and markets
Platform Scope
EarnGit is designed to be platform-agnostic.

It aims to combine the best aspects of existing token launch platforms:

fast deployment
public markets
transparent fees
While adding what they lack:


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠️ Contract address will be updated on the website shortly.
Do not buy fakes or scams.
The only valid contract address will be published officially.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Status
EarnGit is currently live and evolving.

Repository scanning, verification logic, and claiming mechanisms will continue to be refined as usage grows.

Closing
Tokens should reward builders, not impersonators.

Earngit makes sure the right developer gets paid.
